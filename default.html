    <h1>Lolita world overview</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Lolita fashion (ロリータ・ファッション) is a subculture from Japan that is highly influenced by Victorian clothing and styles from the Rococo period. A very distinctive property of Lolita fashion is the aesthetic of cuteness. 
        This clothing subculture can be categorized into three main substyles: 'Gothic', 'Classic', and 'Sweet'.Many other substyles such as 'Sailor', 'Country', 'Hime' (princess), 'Guro' (grotesque), 'Qi' and 'Wa' (based on traditional Chinese and Japanese dress), 'Punk', 'Shiro' (white), 'Kuro' (black), and 'Steampunk' Lolita also exist. 
        This style evolved into a widely followed subculture in Japan and other countries in the 1990s and 2000s and may have waned in Japan as of the 2010s as the fashion became more mainstream.</p>

        <br><h2>History</h2>

    <br><p>The evolution of Lolita fashion, although with an unclear origin, can be traced back to influences from various movements and styles over several decades. At the end of the 1970s, Otome-kei, a precursor to Lolita characterized by a maiden-like simplicity, emerged amidst a growing 'cute' culture in Japan, highlighted by Sanrio's kawaii designs. This period saw an emphasis on cute, child-like handwriting in schools, which eventually blossomed into the widespread kawaii style of the 1980s. The rise of Do-It-Yourself culture subsequently led to 'doll-kei', a direct predecessor of Lolita fashion. A significant shift occurred between 1977 and 1998 when the Harajuku shopping district became a pedestrian paradise on Sundays, fostering a communal atmosphere where brands like Pink House, Milk, and Angelic Pretty started selling cute clothing, laying the foundation for Lolita style.</p>

        <br><p>Term 'Lolita' was officially coined in the September 1987 issue of fashion magazine Ryukou Tsushin, with brands like Baby, The Stars Shine Bright and Metamorphose temps de fille leading the charge in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The style gained mainstream acceptance during this time, propelled by visual kei bands like Malice Mizer, whose members' elaborate attire inspired fans. Japan's economic depression in the 1990s spurred a proliferation of alternative youth cultures, including Lolita, which spread from the Kansai region to Tokyo. Notably, the Jingu Bashi became a nexus for youth in alternative fashions, further popularizing Lolita and giving rise to dedicated fashion outlets.</p>

        <br><p>Significant magazines such as the Gothic & Lolita Bible and FRUiTS were instrumental in broadcasting the fashion style beyond Japan, leading to global awareness and the establishment of flagship stores like Baby, The Stars Shine Bright in Paris and New York. However, the landscape shifted again with the advent of fast fashion, and the once-vibrant street fashion scene in Harajuku and its iconic bridge saw a decline, underscored by the cessation of FRUiTS and the hiatus of the Gothic & Lolita Bible in 2017. This marked a transformational period for Lolita fashion, reflecting the ebb and flow of cultural trends and economic forces.</p>
